        <h1><strong><em>ABOUT ME</em></strong></h1>
        
        <p><ol>is Bhuvaneshwari Kanagaraj, a passionate Embedded and IoT developer. Neil deGrasse Tyson's statement that "everyone should have their minds blown once a day" sums me up in its entirety. With its complex ideas, electronics never ceases to intrigue me and keep me motivated to learn new things every day. Hackathons were highly influential in my life, helping me acquire new technology to life skills. Currently, I am leading a team that has been selected for the next stage of the Transport4All Startup Challenge 2023. I also won the Smart India Hackathon 2022 and was a Top 10 finalist of Toycathon 2021. Teaching has always given me a sense of completeness. I have more than 10 technical sessions around Tamil Nadu. And I'd want to highlight an experience that took place throughout an entire week in October 2022 and shaped me into a great communicator, reflective listener, and empathizer. In addition to my passion for technology, I want to assess a product from its business perspective in a contrast to technology. At the Agile Incubation Centre, executives from startUp TN gave me the best pitch award for an idea. I've picked up so much from life so far, and I'm always eager to learn more. Are you ready to join me on my next tech excursion?
